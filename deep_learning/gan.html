    <h1> Generative Adversarial Neural Networks </h1>
    <h3> Technical background </h3>
    Before starting to play with GANs we need to dive a little bit into some technical concepts to fully understand how they work, its optimizations or different ways of validation.
    <h4>Loss function</h4>
    The loss function is

    <h3> Experimenting with GANs </h3>
    <p> Since I have more experience with Caffe and Darknet, my first option to start playing with GANs was to use one of these frameworks. However, after some internet research, I discovered that literally NOBODY uses those frameworks for this kind of architecture. All I could see was Keras, TF and Pytorch so I decided to use Tensorflow (also as an excuse to see its improvements from the 2nd version). </p>
